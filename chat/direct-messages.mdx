Direct messages (DMs) let you have private conversations with individual team members or AI coworkers. Unlike project channels, DMs are visible only to the participants.

  <Step title="Find the person">
    Look in the sidebar under **Direct Messages** or **Team Members**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click their name">
    A DM conversation opens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start chatting">
    Type your message and press Enter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to AI Coworkers">
    Click **AI Coworkers** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a coworker">
    Choose the AI coworker you want to chat with.
  </Step>

1. Click the **+** button or "New message"
2. Search for a person by name
3. Select them from the results
4. Start your conversation

## DM Features

### Private by Design

DMs are visible only to:
- You
- The other participant

No one else can see your direct messages—not even workspace admins.

### Message History

- Conversation history is preserved
- Scroll up to see past messages
- Search within the conversation

### All Message Features

DMs support everything project channels do:
- Rich text formatting
- File attachments
- Reactions
- Message editing and deletion
- Threads

## Chatting with AI Coworkers

### Starting an AI Conversation

1. Select an AI coworker from the list
2. Type your message or question
3. The AI responds in real-time

### AI Response Streaming

Watch AI responses appear as they're generated:
- Text streams in as it's written
- No waiting for complete response
- You can read while it's still generating

### AI Capabilities in DMs

Depending on the AI coworker, you can:

- Ask questions and get answers
- Request help with writing
- Get analysis and insights
- Delegate tasks
- Generate content

### Example AI Conversations

**Asking for help:**
```
You: Can you help me draft an email to a client about our project delay?
AI: Of course! I'd be happy to help. Could you tell me:
    - The reason for the delay
    - The new expected timeline
    - The tone you'd like (apologetic, matter-of-fact, etc.)
```

**Getting information:**
```
You: What's the best practice for database indexing?
AI: Here are key best practices for database indexing...
```

**Delegating work:**
```
You: Please summarize the main points from this document [attachment]
AI: I've reviewed the document. Here are the main points...
```

## Managing Direct Messages

### Finding Conversations

Recent DMs appear in the sidebar:
- Most recent conversations at the top
- Unread indicators for new messages
- Search to find older conversations

### Starting Fresh

Each time you open a DM, the conversation continues where you left off. For AI coworkers, previous context helps them understand your ongoing needs.

### Clearing History

If needed, you can:
- Delete individual messages
- Start a new conversation thread
- Archive old conversations

## DM Notifications

### Notification Settings

Control how you're notified:

- **All messages**: Notify for every DM
- **Mentions only**: Just when you're mentioned
- **Nothing**: Mute the conversation

### Muting a Conversation

For busy conversations:

1. Open the DM
2. Click the settings icon
3. Select **Mute notifications**
4. Choose duration or permanent

### Unmuting

1. Go to the muted conversation
2. Click settings
3. Select **Unmute**

## Presence in DMs

### Online Status

See if the person is available:
- **Green dot**: Online and active
- **No indicator**: Offline or away
- **Typing...**: Currently composing

### Read Receipts

Know when your message is seen:
- "Delivered" when sent
- "Seen" when they've read it (if enabled)

## DM vs. Project Channels

| Use DMs For | Use Channels For |
|-------------|------------------|
| Private discussions | Project updates |
| Quick questions | Team decisions |
| Personal matters | Shared information |
| One-on-one feedback | Group discussions |
| AI conversations | Project context |

## AI Coworker DM Tips

### Be Specific

The more context you provide, the better the AI can help:

**Less effective:**
```
"Help with the report"
```

**More effective:**
```
"Help me write the executive summary for our Q1 sales report.
Focus on the 15% growth in enterprise accounts and the new
market expansion. Keep it under 200 words."
```

### Use Follow-ups

AI conversations build on context:

```
You: Summarize this article [link]
AI: [provides summary]
You: Now create 3 tweet threads from the key points
AI: [creates tweets based on the summary]
```

### Give Feedback

Help AI improve its responses:
- "That's good, but can you make it more formal?"
- "Can you expand on the second point?"
- "That's not quite what I meant, I was looking for..."
