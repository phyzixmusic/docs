Threads help you organize conversations by grouping related messages together. Instead of cluttering the main channel, detailed discussions can happen in their own thread.

## What Are Threads?

A thread is a focused conversation attached to a specific message. When a topic needs deeper discussion, moving to a thread keeps the main channel clean while preserving the conversation in context.

### Thread Benefits

- **Organization**: Related messages stay together
- **Focus**: Discuss one topic without distracting others
- **Context**: Thread stays connected to the original message
- **Notifications**: Control who gets notified

## Creating a Thread

### Starting a Thread

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the message">
    Locate the message you want to discuss further.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Reply in thread">
    Hover over the message and click the thread/reply icon.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your reply">
    Type your message in the thread view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Press Enter to add your reply to the thread.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Use Threads

Use threads for:
- Detailed follow-up discussions
- Questions that need back-and-forth
- Side conversations that branch from main topic
- Technical discussions with lots of detail
- Feedback and review conversations

## Viewing Threads

### Thread Indicator

Messages with threads show:
- Reply count ("3 replies")
- Participant avatars
- "View thread" link

### Opening a Thread

Click on:
- The "X replies" link
- The thread icon
- Any part of the thread indicator

The thread opens in a side panel.

### Thread Panel

The thread view shows:
- Original message at the top
- All replies below
- Message input at the bottom
- Option to close and return

## Participating in Threads

### Adding Replies

1. Open the thread
2. Type your message
3. Press Enter to send

Your reply is added to the thread conversation.

### Using All Features

Thread messages support:
- Rich text formatting
- File attachments
- Reactions
- Mentions
- Code blocks

Everything you can do in the main channel works in threads.

### Following Threads

When you participate in a thread, you automatically follow it and receive notifications for new replies.

## Thread Notifications

### Who Gets Notified

By default:
- Thread participants receive notifications
- The original message author is notified
- Mentioned users are notified

### Notification Behavior

Thread notifications are separate from channel notifications:
- You might mute a channel but still get thread notifications
- Unfollow specific threads you're no longer interested in

### Managing Thread Notifications

To unfollow a thread:
1. Open the thread
2. Click the settings icon
3. Select "Unfollow thread"

## Threads vs. Main Channel

### When to Reply in Channel

- Brief acknowledgments ("Thanks!")
- Messages relevant to everyone
- New topics unrelated to existing messages
- Quick reactions

### When to Start a Thread

- Detailed responses to a specific message
- Questions that might generate discussion
- Technical deep-dives
- Feedback on specific items
- Anything that needs back-and-forth

## Thread Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep threads focused">
    Each thread should be about one topic. If the conversation shifts, consider starting a new thread or moving to the main channel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reply in thread, not channel">
    If you're responding to something specific, use a thread. Don't clutter the channel with follow-up messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Summarize for the channel">
    After a long thread discussion, post a summary in the main channel so everyone knows the outcome.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check existing threads">
    Before starting a new discussion, check if there's an existing thread on the topic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use mentions strategically">
    Mention someone in a thread if they specifically need to see it. Not everyone in the channel needs every thread notification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Thread Examples

### Question and Answer

**Main channel:**
```

[continued discussion]
```

Alex: Updated. Can you take another look?
Jordan: Looks good now! Approved.

[vote and decision]
Project Lead: Decision: PostgreSQL. Updating the main channel.
