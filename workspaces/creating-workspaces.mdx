A workspace is your team's central hub in Trilo. It contains all your projects, resources, and team members. Most teams have one workspace, but you can create multiple for different organizations or purposes.

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is the top-level container in Trilo that holds:

- **Areas**: High-level organizational categories

## When to Create Multiple Workspaces

### One Workspace (Most Common)

Most teams should use **one workspace**:
- Single team or organization
- Unified communication
- Easier member management
- Consistent settings

### Multiple Workspaces

Consider separate workspaces for:
- **Different organizations**: Completely separate businesses
- **Clients**: Agency managing different client accounts
- **Personal vs. work**: Keep personal projects separate
- **Different departments**: When complete separation is needed

<Info>
  Areas and projects within a single workspace usually provide enough organization without needing multiple workspaces.

  <Step title="Click workspace name">
    Find the workspace name in the top of the sidebar.
