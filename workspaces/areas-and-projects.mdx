Within your workspace, areas and projects create the organizational structure for your work. Understanding how to use them effectively is key to keeping your team organized.

## Organizational Hierarchy

Trilo uses a three-level structure:

```
Workspace
└── Areas (categories)
    └── Projects (where work happens)
        ├── Tasks
        ├── Resources
        ├── Chat
        └── Calendar
```

## Areas

### What Are Areas?

Areas are high-level categories that group related projects. Think of them as folders or departments within your workspace.

**Example areas:**
- Engineering
- Marketing
- Operations
- Client Projects
- Product

### Creating an Area

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the sidebar">
    Look at the navigation sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click + or New Area">
    Find the add button near the Areas section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your area">
    Enter a clear, descriptive name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Your area is created and ready for projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Area Settings

Each area has settings you can configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The area's display name |
| **Description** | Optional description of what this area contains |
| **Icon/Color** | Visual customization for easy identification |

### Managing Areas

#### Renaming

1. Right-click the area name
2. Select **Rename**
3. Enter the new name
4. Press Enter

#### Reordering

Drag areas in the sidebar to reorder them.

#### Archiving

For areas no longer active:

1. Right-click the area
2. Select **Archive**
3. Archived areas are hidden but preserved

## Projects

### What Are Projects?

Projects are where your actual work happens. Each project contains:

- **Tasks**: Work items to complete
- **Resources**: Knowledge base content (pages, spreadsheets, boards)
- **Chat**: Project-specific communication channel
- **Calendar**: Project-related events

### Creating a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to an area">
    Find the area where you want to create a project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click + or New Project">
    Click the add button within the area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the project">
    Enter name, prefix, and other settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Your project is ready to use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Project Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Project's display name |
| **Prefix** | Short code for task IDs (e.g., "PROD" for PROD-1) |
| **Description** | What this project is about |
| **Due date** | Optional project deadline |
| **Status** | Active, Completed, or Archived |
| **AI features** | Enable/disable AI coworkers for this project |

### Project Prefix

The prefix creates unique task IDs:

- Set a 2-4 character prefix
- Tasks get IDs like `PROD-1`, `PROD-2`
- Makes tasks easy to reference in chat and docs

**Good prefix examples:**
- PROD (Product)
- MKT (Marketing)
- ENG (Engineering)
- CLIENT (Client project)

### Managing Projects

1. Open project settings
2. Edit the name field
3. Save changes

#### Moving to Another Area

3. Or right-click and select **Archive**

Archived projects:
- Are hidden from normal view

- Can be restored later

#### Deleting

<Warning>
  Deleting a project removes all its tasks, resources, and chat history permanently.
</Warning>

2. Find **Delete project**
3. Confirm deletion

## Organizing Your Workspace

### By Department/Team

```
Workspace
├── Engineering
│   ├── Backend Development
│   ├── Frontend Development
│   └── DevOps
├── Product
│   ├── Roadmap
│   └── User Research
└── Marketing
    ├── Content
    └── Campaigns
```

### By Client

```
Workspace

│   ├── Operations
│   └── Team Development
├── Client: Acme Corp
│   ├── Website Redesign
│   └── Mobile App
└── Client: Beta Inc
    └── Consulting Project
```

### By Initiative/Quarter

```
Workspace
├── Q1 2024

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep areas broad, projects specific">
    Areas should be high-level categories. Projects should be specific initiatives or ongoing work streams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming">
    Establish naming conventions so everyone can find things easily. Document your conventions for new team members.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archive completed work">
    Don't delete completed projects—archive them. You may need to reference them later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review organization periodically">
    As your team grows, review your structure. What made sense for 5 people may not work for 50.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Star frequently used projects">
    Keep your most-used projects in quick access to reduce navigation time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't find a project">
    - Check if it was archived (view archived items)
    - Use search (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)
    - Check if you have access to the area
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't create projects in an area">
    - Verify you have permission to create projects
    - Check if the area is archived
    - Contact your workspace admin
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project prefix already taken">
    - Each prefix must be unique within a workspace
    - Choose a different prefix
    - Consider adding numbers (MKT1, MKT2)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
