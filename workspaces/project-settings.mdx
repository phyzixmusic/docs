Each project in Trilo has settings that control its behavior, access, and features. This guide covers all project settings and how to configure them.

## Accessing Project Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the project">
    Navigate to the project you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Settings">
    Click the gear icon or **Settings** in the project navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Adjust settings as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## General Settings

### Project Name

The display name for your project:

- Shown in sidebar and navigation
- Used in notifications and emails
- Can be changed anytime

**Tips for good names:**
- Keep it concise but descriptive
- Include client name for client projects
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Project Description

An optional description that helps team members understand:

- What the project is about
- Its goals and objectives
- Any relevant context

Good descriptions include:
- Purpose of the project
- Key stakeholders
- Timeline or deadlines (if applicable)
- Links to relevant resources

### Project Prefix

The short code used for task IDs:

| Setting | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Prefix: `PROD` | Tasks: PROD-1, PROD-2, PROD-3 |
| Prefix: `MKT` | Tasks: MKT-1, MKT-2, MKT-3 |

**Rules:**
- 2-4 characters recommended
- Letters and numbers only
- Must be unique in the workspace
- Cannot be changed after tasks are created (without affecting existing IDs)

### Area Assignment

Which area the project belongs to:

1. Click the **Area** dropdown
2. Select the target area
3. Save changes

Moving projects between areas doesn't affect project data.

## Status Settings

### Project Status

Track the overall state of your project:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Currently in progress |
| **Completed** | Finished but not archived |
| **On Hold** | Paused temporarily |
| **Archived** | No longer active, hidden from view |

### Due Date

Set a target completion date:

- Appears on the project overview
- Can trigger reminders
- Helps with planning and prioritization

## Feature Settings

### AI Features

Control whether AI coworkers can assist in this project:

- **Enabled**: AI coworkers can be assigned tasks, participate in chat
- **Disabled**: AI features are turned off for this project

<Info>
  Disabling AI features might be appropriate for sensitive projects where AI interaction isn't desired.
</Info>

### Feature Toggles

Some features can be enabled or disabled per project:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tasks** | Task management |
| **Resources** | Knowledge base |
| **Chat** | Project channel |
| **Calendar** | Project-specific events |

Most projects use all features, but you can disable unused ones to simplify the interface.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set up projects completely">
    When creating a new project, take time to configure all settings properly. It's easier than fixing them later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive descriptions">
    A good project description saves time explaining the project to new team members.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choose prefixes wisely">
    Pick a prefix you can live with long-term. Changing it later affects task ID continuity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review member access">
    Periodically check who has access to projects. Remove members who no longer need access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archive instead of delete">
    When in doubt, archive rather than delete. You can always delete later, but you can't recover deleted projects.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
