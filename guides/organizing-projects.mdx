Well-organized projects help teams work efficiently and find information quickly. This guide covers strategies and best practices for project organization in Trilo.

## Project Organization Philosophy

### Principles

Good project organization follows these principles:

1. **Findability**: Anyone should find what they need quickly
2. **Consistency**: Similar things are organized the same way
3. **Scalability**: Structure works as the project grows
4. **Clarity**: Purpose and contents are obvious

### Questions to Ask

Before creating a project, consider:

- What work will happen here?
- Who needs access?
- How long will this project be active?
- What content types will it contain?
- How does it relate to other projects?

## Workspace Structure

### Organizing Areas

Areas are your top-level organization:

**By Department:**
```
├── Engineering
├── Marketing
├── Sales
├── Operations
└── Executive
```

**By Client:**
```
├── Internal
├── Client: Acme Corp
├── Client: Beta Industries
└── Client: Gamma Tech
```

**By Initiative:**
```
├── Product
├── Growth
├── Infrastructure
└── Culture
```

### Choosing the Right Structure

| Structure | Best For | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Department** | Functional teams | Engineering, Marketing |
| **Client** | Service businesses | Client projects |
| **Initiative** | Startups, project-focused | Quarterly goals |
| **Hybrid** | Complex organizations | Mix of above |

## Project Types

### Active Projects

Projects with ongoing work:

- Regular activity from team
- Active tasks and discussions
- Frequently updated resources

**Examples:**
- Product Development
- Marketing Campaigns
- Customer Support

### Reference Projects

Projects primarily for documentation:

- Less frequent updates
- Mostly knowledge base content
- Reference material

**Examples:**
- Company Handbook
- Brand Guidelines
- Technical Documentation

### Time-Bound Projects

Projects with defined start and end:

- Specific deliverable or goal
- Clear timeline
- Will be completed/archived

**Examples:**
- Q1 Product Launch
- Office Move
- Annual Conference

## Naming Conventions

### Project Names

Use clear, descriptive names:

**Good names:**
- "Mobile App Development"
- "Q1 2024 Marketing Campaign"
- "Customer Onboarding Process"

**Avoid:**
- "Project X"
- "Stuff"
- Abbreviations without context

### Prefixes

Choose meaningful task prefixes:

| Project | Good Prefix | Why |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Mobile App | `APP` | Clear, short |
| Marketing | `MKT` | Standard abbreviation |
| Backend API | `API` | Technical but clear |
| Customer Support | `SUP` | Recognizable |

### Consistency

Apply naming patterns consistently:

- Same format across similar projects
- Document your conventions
- Train new team members

## Within-Project Organization

### Task Organization

Organize tasks effectively:

**By Status:**
- Use the built-in statuses (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Keep backlog for future ideas
- Move tasks through stages

**By Priority:**
- Urgent for critical items
- High for important
- Medium for standard
- Low for nice-to-haves

**By Assignee:**
- Clear ownership
- Don't over-assign one person
- Use filters to see individual workloads

### Resource Organization

Organize knowledge base content:

**Page Naming:**
```
Meeting Notes - 2024-01-15
Product Requirements - Feature X
How to: Deploy to Production
[Template] Project Brief
```

**Logical Grouping:**
- Group related pages together
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Archive outdated content

## Templates and Standards

### Project Templates

Create templates for common project types:

**Starter content:**
- Welcome/overview page
- Standard task list
- Common resources

### Document Templates

Create reusable document templates:

- Meeting notes template
- Project brief template
- Decision log template
- Status update template

### Task Templates

For recurring task sets:

- Sprint checklist
- Release tasks
- Onboarding tasks
- Review process

## Managing Project Lifecycle

### Maintaining a Project
