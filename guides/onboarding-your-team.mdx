Successfully onboarding your team to Trilo ensures everyone gets value from the platform quickly. This guide walks you through the entire process from setup to adoption.

## Preparation Phase

### Before You Begin

Gather information you'll need:

- [ ] Team member list and email addresses
- [ ] Organizational structure (who works on what)
- [ ] Current tools and workflows to replace/integrate
- [ ] Key projects and ongoing work
- [ ] Any specific requirements or concerns

### Plan Your Structure

Design your workspace organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Areas">
    List the high-level categories (departments, teams, or initiatives).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Projects">
    Identify projects within each area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine Access">
    Decide who needs access to what.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Conventions">
    Establish naming conventions and usage guidelines.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example structure:**
```
Workspace: Acme Inc
├── Engineering
│   ├── Platform Development
│   └── Mobile App
├── Marketing
│   ├── Content
│   └── Campaigns
└── Operations
    └── Company Initiatives
```

## Setting Up Your Workspace

### Step 1: Create the Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your workspace">
    If you haven't already, create your workspace with a clear name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up areas">
    Create areas based on your organizational plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create initial projects">
    Add key projects to each area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure project settings">
    Set prefixes, descriptions, and basic settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Prepare Content

Before inviting your team, prepare some initial content:

- **Welcome document**: Create a page explaining how your team uses Trilo
- **Guidelines**: Document your conventions and best practices
- **Templates**: Create templates for common document types
- **Sample tasks**: Add some initial tasks to demonstrate the workflow

### Step 3: Configure Settings

Set up workspace-level settings:

- [ ] Workspace name and logo
- [ ] Default timezone
- [ ] Security settings (2FA requirements if needed)
- [ ] Integration connections (calendars, etc.)

## Inviting Your Team

### Invitation Strategy

Don't invite everyone at once. Use a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Core Team**
- Invite key team members first
- Get feedback on structure and settings
- Adjust based on input

**Phase 2: Extended Team**
- Invite remaining team members
- Core team can help with questions
- Scale more confidently

### Sending Invitations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings > Members">
    Navigate to member management.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare invitation list">
    Organize by role (Admin, Member, Guest).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send invitations">
    Invite batch by batch with appropriate roles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow up">
    Ensure everyone accepts their invitation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Role Assignment

Assign roles thoughtfully:

| Role | Assign To |
|------|-----------|
| **Admin** | Team leads who need to manage settings |
| **Member** | Regular team members |
| **Guest** | External collaborators |
