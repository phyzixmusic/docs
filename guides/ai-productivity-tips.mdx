AI coworkers can significantly boost your productivity when used effectively. This guide shares strategies and tips for getting maximum value from AI assistance in Trilo.

## Getting Started with AI

### Your First AI Interactions

Start with simple, common tasks:

1. **Ask questions**: "What's the best way to..."
2. **Get explanations**: "Explain [concept] simply"
3. **Summarize content**: "Summarize this document"
4. **Draft content**: "Write a brief email about..."

### Building Comfort

As you get comfortable, try more complex tasks:

- Multi-step requests
- Creative brainstorming
- Analysis and recommendations
- Content editing and improvement

## High-Impact Use Cases

### Daily Productivity

**Morning planning:**
```
"Help me prioritize these tasks for today:
[list your tasks]
Consider deadlines and importance."
```

**Email drafting:**
```
"Write a professional email to [recipient] about [topic].
Include: [key points].
Tone: [professional/friendly/formal]"
```

**Meeting prep:**
```
"I have a meeting about [topic] in an hour.
Create an agenda with key discussion points and
questions I should ask."
```

### Writing and Content

**Document drafting:**
```
"Create an outline for a document about [topic].
Audience: [who will read it]
Purpose: [what it should accomplish]"
```

**Editing and improving:**
```
"Review this text and suggest improvements for:
1. Clarity
2. Conciseness
3. Professional tone
[paste your text]"
```

**Creative content:**
```
"Brainstorm 10 headlines for our blog post about [topic].
Target audience: [audience description]
Tone: [desired tone]"
```

### Analysis and Research

**Data interpretation:**
```
"I have this data: [paste data]
What patterns or insights do you see?
What recommendations would you make?"
```

**Competitive analysis:**
```
"Compare these two approaches: [A] vs [B]
List pros and cons of each.
Make a recommendation based on [criteria]."
```

**Problem solving:**
```
"We're facing this challenge: [describe problem]
What are possible solutions?
What are the tradeoffs of each?"
```

### Technical Tasks

**Code help:**
```
"Explain how to implement [feature] in [language].
Include a basic code example."
```

**Documentation:**
```
"Write documentation for this function:
[paste code]
Include: purpose, parameters, return value, example usage."
```

**Debugging:**
```
"I'm getting this error: [error message]
Here's my code: [paste code]
What's causing this and how do I fix it?"
```

## Effective Prompting

### The CONTEXT Framework

Structure your requests for better results:

- **C**ontext: Background information
- **O**bjective: What you want to achieve
- **N**uances: Specific requirements
- **T**one: Desired style
- **E**xamples: What good looks like
- **X**tra: Any constraints

**Example:**
```
Context: I'm a product manager preparing a quarterly review.
Objective: Create a presentation outline.
Nuances: Focus on metrics and achievements, not excuses.
Tone: Confident but honest.
Example: Previous quarters used 5 sections with 3-4 slides each.
Extra: Keep it under 20 slides total.
```

### Specificity Matters

**Vague (less helpful):**
```
"Write something about our product."
```

**Specific (more helpful):**
```
"Write a 150-word product description for our project management app.
Target audience: Small business owners
Key features to highlight: Task tracking, team collaboration, mobile app
Tone: Professional but friendly
Call to action: Start free trial"
```

### Iterate and Refine

Don't expect perfection on the first try:

```
You: Write a tagline for our productivity app.
AI: "Work smarter, not harder."

You: That's too generic. Focus on our AI features.
AI: "Your AI-powered productivity partner."

You: Better! Can you make it more action-oriented?
AI: "Supercharge your workflow with AI assistance."

You: Perfect!
```

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Workflows

**Morning routine:**
1. Check tasks, ask AI to help prioritize
2. Draft any emails needed
3. Prepare for meetings

**During work:**
1. Use AI for quick research
2. Get drafts for content
3. Brainstorm solutions to problems

**End of day:**
1. Summarize accomplishments
2. Plan for tomorrow
3. Draft status updates

### Project Workflows

**Starting a project:**
- Generate project plan outline
- Create initial task list
- Draft project brief

**During a project:**
- Get help with content creation
- Analyze progress and blockers
- Prepare status updates

**Completing a project:**
- Summarize outcomes
- Document lessons learned
- Draft announcements

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought

For complex problems, ask AI to think step-by-step:

```
"I need to decide between two vendors.
Walk me through this step by step:
1. What criteria should I consider?
2. How should I weight each criterion?
3. Apply this to: Vendor A [details] vs Vendor B [details]
4. Make a recommendation"
```

### Role Assignment

Give the AI a specific role:

```
"Act as an experienced marketing strategist.
Review our current approach and suggest improvements.
[details]"
```

### Multiple Perspectives

Get different viewpoints:

```
"For this decision, give me:
1. The optimistic perspective
2. The pessimistic perspective
3. The pragmatic recommendation
[describe the decision]"
```

### Feedback Loops

Build on previous responses:

```
Conversation 1: Get initial draft
Conversation 2: Refine specific sections
Conversation 3: Polish and finalize
```

## When to Use AI (and When Not To)

### Great for AI

| Task | Why It Works |
|------|--------------|
| First drafts | AI gets you started, you refine |
| Brainstorming | AI generates options quickly |
| Summarizing | AI extracts key points efficiently |
| Explaining | AI can simplify complex topics |
| Formatting | AI restructures content well |

### Better for Humans

| Task | Why |
|------|-----|
| Final decisions | Judgment and accountability |
| Sensitive communication | Nuance and relationships |
| Original strategy | Business context and creativity |
| Confidential matters | Privacy considerations |
| Critical accuracy | Verification needed |

### Always Review

AI outputs should always be reviewed:

- Check facts and accuracy
- Verify tone is appropriate
- Ensure content fits your context
- Add personal touches

## Productivity Multipliers

### Templates with AI

Create templates, then use AI to fill them:

```
"Fill in this template with information about [project]:

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Goals
[3-5 goals]

## Timeline
[Key milestones]

## Risks
[Potential challenges]"
```

### Batch Processing

Group similar tasks:

```
"I need to write thank-you notes to these people.
Create a personalized paragraph for each:
1. Sarah - helped with the presentation
2. Mike - covered my meetings last week
3. Lisa - gave great feedback on the proposal"
```

### Learning and Growth

Use AI to learn faster:

```
"I'm trying to improve at [skill].
1. What are the key concepts I should understand?
2. What's a good practice exercise?
3. What common mistakes should I avoid?"
```

## Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Over-relying on AI">
    AI is a tool, not a replacement. Use it to enhance your work, not do all your thinking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not reviewing outputs">
    Always review AI outputs before using them. Errors and inaccuracies happen.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vague prompts">
    Specific requests get better results. Include context, constraints, and examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Forgetting to iterate">
    First responses are rarely perfect. Build on them through conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asking for private/sensitive info">
    Don't share confidential information with AI unnecessarily.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building AI Habits

### Start Small

Pick one daily task to enhance with AI:
- Email drafting
- Meeting prep
- Content summarization

### Track What Works

Note when AI helps most:
- What types of requests work well
- Which prompts get best results
- Where AI saves the most time

### Share with Team

Help others learn:
- Share effective prompts
- Document useful workflows
- Create team AI guidelines
