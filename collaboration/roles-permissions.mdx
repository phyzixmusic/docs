Roles and permissions control what people can see and do in your workspace. Understanding these helps you set up appropriate access for everyone on your team.

## Role Hierarchy

Trilo has two levels of roles:

1. **Workspace roles**: Control access across the entire workspace
2. **Project roles**: Control access within specific projects

### Project Roles

## Role Strategies

### Small Teams (2-10 people)

- **Owner**: Founder or team lead
- **Admins**: 1-2 key team members
- **Members**: Everyone else

Keep it simple—most people can be Members.

### Growing Teams (10-50 people)

- **Owner**: CEO or department head
- **Admins**: Team leads, department managers
- **Members**: Regular employees
- **Guests**: Contractors, external partners

Use project roles to give specific people more control in their areas.

### Enterprise (50+ people)

- **Owner**: IT administrator or executive
- **Admins**: Department heads, team leads
- **Members**: Most employees
- **Guests**: External collaborators, clients

Use detailed project permissions and consider:
- Limiting Admin count
- Using Guests more liberally for external access
- Project-level permissions for fine-grained control

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with minimal access">
    Give people the minimum permissions they need. It's easier to grant more access than to restrict it later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit Admin count">
    Too many admins can lead to inconsistent settings and confusion. Keep Admin count low.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Guests for external people">
    Always use Guest role for people outside your organization. This protects sensitive information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review permissions regularly">
    Audit who has access periodically. Remove access for people who no longer need it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document your permission structure">
    Write down who gets what role and why. This helps with consistency as your team grows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Special Cases

### Transferring Ownership

To transfer workspace ownership:

1. Both parties must have accounts
2. Current owner initiates transfer
3. New owner accepts
4. Old owner becomes Admin

### Temporary Elevated Access

When someone needs temporary higher access:

1. Elevate their role as needed
2. Set a reminder to review
3. Reduce role when no longer needed

### Emergency Access

If the owner is unavailable:
- Admins can handle most operations
- Contact Trilo support for ownership issues
- Have a backup plan for critical access

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Member can't access a project">
    - Check if they're added to the project
    - Verify their project role allows access
    - Ensure the project isn't archived
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't change someone's role">
    - Verify you have permission (Admin+ to change roles)
    - You can't elevate someone above your own level
    - Owners can only be changed through ownership transfer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Guest can see too much">
    - Review which projects they're added to
    - Check project-level permissions
    - Remove from projects they shouldn't access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Member should be Admin">
    - Only Owner or Admin can promote to Admin
    - Go to Settings > Members
    - Change their workspace role
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
