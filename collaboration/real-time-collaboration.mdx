Trilo is built for real-time collaboration. See changes as they happen, know when teammates are online, and work together seamlessly whether you're in the same room or across the world.

## Real-Time Features

### Instant Updates

Everything syncs in real-time:

- **Messages** appear instantly
- **Task changes** reflect immediately
- **Document edits** show as you type
- **Calendar updates** sync across views

No refreshing needed—changes appear as they happen.

### Presence Indicators

Know who's active in your workspace:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Green dot** | User is online and active |
| **Yellow dot** | User is online but idle |
| **No dot** | User is offline |

Presence shows in:
- Member lists
- Chat conversations
- Document editing

## Collaborative Editing

### Working on Documents Together

Multiple people can edit the same page simultaneously:

**What you see:**
- Other users' cursors with their names
- Changes appearing in real-time
- Who's currently viewing the document

**How it works:**
1. Open a page that others are viewing
2. See their cursors and selections
3. Type and watch your changes appear for everyone
4. Their changes appear on your screen instantly

### Conflict-Free Editing

Trilo uses advanced technology to prevent conflicts:

- Two people can type in different places simultaneously
- Overlapping edits are merged intelligently
- No "save conflicts" or locked documents
- Changes sync automatically
