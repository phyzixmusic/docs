## The Invitation Process

### What Invitees Receive

Invited people receive an email containing:
- Workspace name and who invited them
- Link to accept the invitation
- Instructions for getting started

### Accepting an Invitation

When someone clicks the invitation link:

1. **New users**: Create a Trilo account, then join the workspace
2. **Existing users**: Sign in and join the workspace directly

### Invitation Status

Track invitation status in Members settings:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Invitation sent, not yet accepted |
| **Accepted** | Invitation accepted, member active |
| **Expired** | Invitation not accepted in time |

### Resending Invitations

If someone hasn't received or lost their invitation:

1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Find the pending invitation
3. Click **Resend**
4. A new email is sent

### Revoking Invitations

Cancel a pending invitation:

1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Find the pending invitation
3. Click **Revoke** or the X icon
4. The invitation link no longer works

## Inviting Guests

Guests have limited access, perfect for external collaborators.

### When to Use Guest Access

- External contractors or freelancers
- Clients who need project visibility
- Partners collaborating on specific work
- Temporary collaborators

### Inviting a Guest

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start invitation">
    Go to **Settings > Members > Invite**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter email">
    Add the guest's email address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Guest role">
    Choose **Guest** from the role dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select projects">
    Choose which projects the guest can access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    The guest receives an invitation with limited access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Guest Limitations

Guests can:
- Access assigned projects only
- View and interact with allowed content
- Participate in project chat
- Be assigned tasks (depending on permissions)

Guests cannot:
- See other projects in the workspace
- Access workspace settings
- Invite other members
- See the full member list

## Bulk Invitations

### Inviting Multiple People

Add several people at once:

1. In the invite form, enter multiple emails
2. Separate with commas or new lines
3. All receive the same role
4. Send invitations

**Example:**
```
alice@company.com, bob@company.com, carol@company.com
```

### Different Roles for Different People

To assign different roles:
- Send separate invitations for each role
- Or invite everyone as Members, then upgrade specific people to Admin

## Managing Pending Invitations

### Viewing Pending Invitations

In **Settings > Members**, you can see:
- All pending invitations
- When each was sent
- Who sent the invitation
- The assigned role

### Invitation Expiration

Invitations expire after a set period (typically 7 days). After expiration:
- The link no longer works
- You can send a new invitation

## After Someone Joins

### New Member Onboarding

When someone accepts an invitation:

1. They appear in the Members list
2. They get access based on their role
3. They can start exploring the workspace

### Adding to Projects

For members who need project access:

1. Go to the project
2. Open project settings > Members
3. Add the new member
4. Set their project role

Or with default access settings, members may automatically have access to projects.

## Invitation Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate roles">
    Give people the minimum access they need. Start with Member and upgrade to Admin only if necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add context to invitations">
    When inviting, let people know (via separate email) what the workspace is for and what they'll be working on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Follow up on pending invitations">
    Check periodically for pending invitations. Follow up with people who haven't accepted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean up regularly">
    Remove members who no longer need access. Revoke invitations that won't be accepted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use guests for external people">
    Always use Guest role for people outside your organization. This protects sensitive workspace information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invitation email not received">
    - Check spam/junk folder
    - Verify email address is correct
    - Try resending the invitation
    - Check if corporate email filters might block it
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invitation link not working">
    - The invitation may have expired
    - The invitation may have been revoked
    - Send a new invitation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't invite someone">
    - Verify you have Admin permissions
    - Check if they're already a member
    - Ensure you're entering a valid email
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New member can't see projects">
    - They need to be added to specific projects
    - Check project access settings
    - Verify their role has appropriate permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Removing Members

### Removing from Workspace

To remove someone completely:

1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Find the member
3. Click **Remove** or the menu icon
4. Confirm removal

The person loses all access immediately.

### Deactivating vs. Removing

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Remove** | Completely removes from workspace |
| **Deactivate** | Suspends access, preserves their activity history |

Use deactivation when you might want to restore access later.
