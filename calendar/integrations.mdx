### Outlook Sync Features

- View Outlook events in Trilo
- See availability from Outlook
- Create events that sync both ways
- Support for Office 365 accounts

## How Sync Works

### Sync Frequency

Calendar syncs happen:
- **Automatically**: Every few minutes
- **On action**: When you open the calendar
- **Manual refresh**: Click refresh to sync immediately

### Conflict Handling

When the same event exists in multiple places:
- Events are matched by unique identifiers
- Changes in source calendar take priority
- Deleted events are removed from sync

### Event Details

Synced events include:
- Title
- Date and time
- Duration
- Location
- Description (if permitted)

<Warning>
  Private or confidential events may sync with limited details based on your privacy settings in the source calendar.
</Warning>

## Viewing Synced Events

### Identifying Synced Events

Synced events are marked with:
- Source calendar indicator
- Integration icon (Google, Outlook)
- Different color coding (optional)

### Editing Synced Events

Depending on configuration:
- **Some events**: Edit in Trilo, changes sync back
- **Some events**: View-only in Trilo, edit in source calendar
- **New events**: Can be created in either system

## Multiple Calendars

### Managing Multiple Sources

You can connect:
- Multiple Google accounts
- Multiple Outlook accounts
- Mix of different calendar services

### Calendar Colors

Assign colors to different calendars:
- Personal calendar: Blue
- Work calendar: Green
- Team calendar: Purple

This helps distinguish events at a glance.

### Toggling Visibility

Show or hide calendars:
1. Open calendar settings
2. Toggle visibility for each calendar
3. Hidden calendars don't display events

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not syncing">
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify the calendar is selected for sync
    - Try disconnecting and reconnecting
    - Click refresh to force a sync
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong time showing for events">
    - Check timezone settings in Trilo
    - Verify timezone in the source calendar
    - Events should display in your local timezone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't connect calendar">
    - Ensure pop-ups are allowed for authentication
    - Try a different browser
    - Check that you're using a supported calendar type
    - Verify your account has calendar access enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing events after sync">
    - Some private events may not sync
    - Check if the calendar is selected for sync
    - Verify date range (very old events may not sync)
    - Check if the event was deleted in the source
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate events appearing">

## Privacy Considerations

When connecting calendars:

- Trilo requests only necessary permissions
- Event data is stored securely
- You control which calendars sync
- Disconnect anytime to stop syncing
- Private events respect privacy settings

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connect relevant calendars only">
    Don't sync every calendar you have. Choose the ones you need to see in Trilo for work purposes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent event creation">
    Decide whether to create events in Trilo or your source calendar. Consistency prevents confusion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review sync periodically">
    Occasionally check that sync is working correctly. Look for missing or duplicate events.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set appropriate privacy levels">
    In your source calendar, set events you want to share as public/free, and sensitive events as private.
  </Accordion>
