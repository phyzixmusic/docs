## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive titles">
    Include key information in the title so it's clear at a glance. "Team sync" is okay, "Weekly Marketing Team Sync" is better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Always add a location">
    Even for virtual meetings, add the meeting link. It makes joining easy and prevents confusion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set appropriate reminders">
    Important meetings warrant multiple reminders. Quick check-ins might only need one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include an agenda">
    Use the description to list what will be covered. This helps everyone come prepared.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invite the right people">
    Only invite people who need to attend. Others can be informed separately.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event shows wrong time">
    - Check your timezone settings in your profile
    - Verify the event was created in the correct timezone
    - Refresh the calendar view
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Participants didn't receive invite">
    - Verify they're members of your workspace
    - Check their notification settings
    - Re-add them to the event
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't edit an event">
    - You may not have edit permissions
    - The event might be synced from an external calendar
    - Check if it's a recurring event (may need to edit the series)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
