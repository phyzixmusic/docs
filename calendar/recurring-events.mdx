## Recurrence Patterns

Event repeats on specific days each week:

### Monthly

Event repeats once a month:

- **Same date**: e.g., the 15th of each month
- **Same day**: e.g., first Monday of each month
- **Every X months**: Custom interval

**Best for:**
- Monthly reviews
- End-of-month deadlines

### Yearly

Event repeats once a year:

## Recurrence Options

### Start Date

When the recurring series begins:
- Defaults to the event date
- Can be set to a future date

### End Conditions

Choose when the series ends:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Never** | Events continue indefinitely |
| **After X occurrences** | Ends after a specific number of events |
| **On date** | Ends on a specific date |

<Tip>
  For ongoing meetings, choose "Never" and delete the series when no longer needed. For limited-duration events (like a 6-week course), set a specific end date.
</Tip>

## Managing Recurring Events

### Editing Single Occurrences

Change just one event in the series:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the event">
    Open the specific occurrence you want to change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit time, location, participants, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose scope">
    When prompted, select **This event only**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Only this occurrence is changed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing the Entire Series

Change all events in the series:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click any event in the series">
    Open any occurrence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the properties you want to change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose scope">
    Select **All events** or **This and future events**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes apply to selected events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Edit Options

When editing a recurring event:

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **This event only** | Changes only this occurrence |
| **This and future events** | Changes this and all future occurrences |
| **All events** | Changes every event in the series |

### Deleting Occurrences

Remove individual events:

1. Open the event to delete
2. Click **Delete**
3. Choose **This event only**
4. The rest of the series continues

### Deleting the Series

Remove the entire recurring series:

1. Open any event in the series
2. Click **Delete**
3. Choose **All events**
4. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a series removes all past and future occurrences. Consider deleting only future events if you want to preserve history.
</Warning>

## Exceptions

Sometimes you need to skip or modify specific occurrences.

### Skipping an Occurrence

To skip one event in a series (like a meeting on a holiday):

1. Open the specific occurrence
2. Click **Delete**
3. Choose **This event only**
4. The other events remain

### Rescheduling an Occurrence

Move just one event to a different time:

1. Open the specific occurrence
2. Change the date or time
3. Choose **This event only**
4. Save the change

The rest of the series continues as scheduled.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set realistic recurrence">
    Don't over-schedule. Too many recurring meetings can overwhelm calendars. Question whether every recurring meeting is necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review recurring events regularly">
    Periodically audit your recurring events. Cancel or adjust ones that are no longer useful.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use exceptions wisely">
    It's fine to skip or reschedule individual occurrences. This keeps the series intact while accommodating real-world schedule changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include clear descriptions">
    Since recurring events happen often, make sure the description includes context for regular attendees and newcomers alike.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider time zones">
    For teams across time zones, choose times that work reasonably for everyone, or rotate times periodically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Changed event affecting wrong occurrences">
    When editing, make sure you select the correct scope (this event only, this and future, or all events).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recurring event not appearing">
    - Check the start date is in the past or present
    - Verify the recurrence pattern is correct
    - Make sure it wasn't accidentally deleted
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't edit past occurrences">
    Past events may have limited editing options. You can typically only modify future occurrences.
  </Accordion>
