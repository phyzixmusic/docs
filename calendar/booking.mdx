Booking pages allow external people to schedule meetings with you without the back-and-forth of finding a time. Share your booking link and let others pick a time that works for both of you.

## How Booking Works

1. **You set up** your booking page with available times
2. **You share** the booking link with others
3. **They choose** a time from your available slots
4. **Both calendars** update with the meeting

## Setting Up Your Booking Page

### Enable Booking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Click **Settings** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Booking">
    Find the **Booking** or **Scheduling** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable booking page">
    Toggle on your public booking page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    Set up your availability and preferences.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Basic Settings

Configure your booking page essentials:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Display name** | The name shown on your booking page |
| **Bio** | Brief description about you or your role |
| **Booking link** | Your unique URL (customizable) |
| **Timezone** | Your default timezone for availability |

## Availability Settings

### Working Hours

Set when you're available for bookings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define work days">
    Select which days of the week you accept bookings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set daily hours">
    For each day, set start and end times.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add breaks">
    Optionally exclude lunch or other regular breaks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example configuration:**
- Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- Lunch break: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
- Weekends: Unavailable

### Buffer Time

Add padding around meetings:

| Buffer Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Before** | Time before meetings (preparation) |
| **After** | Time after meetings (notes, decompression) |

**Example:**
- 15 minutes before each meeting
- 10 minutes after each meeting

This prevents back-to-back scheduling.

### Minimum Notice

Set how far in advance bookings must be made:

- **1 hour**: Same-day bookings allowed
- **24 hours**: Next-day minimum
- **48 hours**: Two-day advance notice
- **1 week**: Week-ahead planning

### Maximum Advance

Limit how far ahead people can book:

- **1 week**: Only near-term availability
- **2 weeks**: Short-term scheduling
- **1 month**: Standard advance booking
- **3 months**: Long-term availability

## Meeting Types

Create different booking options:

### Default Meeting

Your standard meeting type:
- Default duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
- General purpose

### Custom Meeting Types

Create specialized options:

**Examples:**
- **Quick Chat** - 15 minutes
- **Standard Meeting** - 30 minutes
- **Deep Dive** - 60 minutes
- **Consultation** - 45 minutes

### Meeting Type Settings

For each type, configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | What the meeting is called |
| **Duration** | How long the meeting lasts |
| **Description** | What the meeting is for |
| **Location** | Default location or meeting link |

## Sharing Your Booking Link

### Your Booking URL

Your booking page has a unique URL:

```
trilo.app/book/your-username
```

Or with a custom slug:
```
trilo.app/book/your-company
```

### Where to Share

- Email signature
- Website "Schedule a meeting" link
- Social media profiles
- Email responses when scheduling

### Multiple Links

Share specific meeting types directly:

```
trilo.app/book/your-username/quick-chat
trilo.app/book/your-username/consultation
```

## Booking Page Customization

### Appearance

Customize how your booking page looks:

## Blocking Time

### Manual Blocks

Block time when you're unavailable:

1. Create an event on your calendar
2. Mark it as "Busy" or "Out of office"
3. That time won't appear as available for booking

### Calendar Integration

Connected calendars affect availability:

- Events from Google/Outlook block booking slots
- This prevents double-booking
- Keep connected calendars up to date

## Limits and Controls

### Daily Limits

Control how many meetings can be booked:

- **Max bookings per day**: Limit daily meetings (e.g., 5)
- Prevents overwhelm on busy days

### Date-Specific Rules

Customize specific dates:

- Block holidays
- Add extra availability for specific days
- Override regular hours temporarily
