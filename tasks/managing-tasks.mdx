Once tasks are created, you'll need to manage them through their lifecycle. This guide covers everything from updating status to archiving completed work.

## Opening a Task

Click on any task to open its detail view, where you can:

- View and edit all task properties
- Add or update the description
- See and add attachments
- Review the activity history
- Add comments and updates

## Updating Task Status

### Quick Status Change

The fastest way to update status:

**In List View:**
- Click the status badge on any task
- Select the new status from the dropdown

**In Kanban View:**
- Drag the task card to a different column
- Drop it in the new status column

**In Table View:**
- Click the status cell
- Select from the dropdown

### Status Workflow

Tasks typically flow through these stages:

```
Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done
```

But you can move tasks to any status at any time—there's no enforced linear workflow.

### Bulk Status Updates

Update multiple tasks at once:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select tasks">
    Use checkboxes to select multiple tasks, or Shift+click for a range.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open bulk actions">
    A toolbar appears with bulk action options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose action">
    Select "Change status" and pick the new status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    All selected tasks are updated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Tasks

### Inline Editing

Edit properties directly from list or table views:

- Click on any editable field
- Make your change
- Click away or press Enter to save

### Full Edit Mode

For comprehensive editing:

1. Click on the task to open it
2. Edit any field in the detail view
3. Changes save automatically

### Editable Properties

| Property | How to Edit |
|----------|-------------|
| **Title** | Click and type |
| **Status** | Click dropdown or drag (Kanban) |
| **Priority** | Click dropdown |
| **Assignee** | Click and select team member |
| **Due Date** | Click and pick date |
| **Description** | Click description area and type |

## Task Activity

### Activity Log

Every task maintains a complete history:

- **Created**: When and by whom
- **Status changes**: Each transition with timestamp
- **Edits**: What changed and who made the change
- **Assignments**: When assignee changed
- **Comments**: Discussion thread

### Tracking Changes

The activity log shows:

```
Jan 15, 2:30 PM - Sarah moved this task to "In Progress"
Jan 15, 10:00 AM - Alex assigned this task to Sarah
Jan 14, 4:45 PM - Alex created this task
```

This helps you understand a task's journey and who's been involved.

## Organizing Tasks

### Sorting

Sort tasks in list and table views by:

- **Priority**: Urgent first or Low first
- **Due Date**: Upcoming first or furthest first
- **Created**: Newest or oldest first
- **Title**: Alphabetical
- **Status**: By workflow stage

### Moving Tasks Between Projects

To move a task to a different project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the task">
    Click to view task details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click More options">
    Find the **...** menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Move to...">
    Choose the destination project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The task moves and gets a new ID based on the new project's prefix.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Moving a task changes its ID and may affect who has access to it based on project permissions.
</Warning>

## Archiving and Deleting

### Archiving Tasks

Archive completed tasks to keep your active list clean:

1. Open the task
2. Click **...** menu
3. Select **Archive**

### Deleting Tasks

## Working with Subtasks

```

Check items off as you complete them by clicking the checkbox.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Update status promptly">
    Change task status as you start and finish work. This keeps everyone informed and makes reporting accurate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archive instead of delete">
    Unless a task was created by mistake, archive rather than delete. You never know when you'll need to reference past work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep tasks current">
    Regularly review your tasks. Update outdated descriptions, adjust due dates, and archive completed work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the activity log">
    When you need context on a task, check the activity log to see what's happened and who's been involved.
  </Accordion>
