## Task Properties

### Title

Write clear, actionable titles that describe what needs to be done:

<Tip>
  Good task titles start with a verb and are specific. Instead of "Homepage," write "Update homepage hero section with new messaging."
</Tip>

**Examples of good titles:**
- "Fix login button not responding on mobile"
- "Write documentation for API authentication"
- "Design icons for navigation menu"
- "Review and merge PR #142"

### Status

Choose the appropriate starting status:

| Status | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Backlog** | Future work, not yet planned |
| **To Do** | Planned for upcoming work |
| **In Progress** | Starting work immediately |
| **Done** | Already completed (rare for new tasks) |

Most new tasks start as **To Do** or **Backlog**.

### Priority

Set the urgency level:

| Priority | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Low** | Nice to have, can wait | Minor improvements, polish items |
| **Medium** | Standard work | Regular features, typical fixes |
| **High** | Important, should be addressed soon | Key features, significant bugs |
| **Urgent** | Critical, needs immediate attention | Production issues, blockers |

<Warning>
  Avoid marking everything as urgent or high priority—it defeats the purpose of prioritization.
</Warning>

### Assignee

Assign the task to:

- **Specific team member**: The person responsible for completing the task
- **AI coworker**: For tasks that can be automated or AI-assisted
- **Unassigned**: When you don't know who should work on it yet

### Due Date

Set a deadline when the task needs to be completed:

1. Click the due date field
2. Select a date from the calendar
3. Optionally set a time for specific deadlines

**Due date tips:**
- Set realistic deadlines
- Consider dependencies on other tasks
- Leave buffer time for review

### Description

Use the description for:

- **Context**: Why this task matters
- **Requirements**: What needs to be done
- **Acceptance criteria**: How you'll know it's complete
- **Resources**: Links to designs, documentation, or references

The description supports markdown formatting:

```markdown
## Overview
Brief explanation of the task.

## Requirements
- First requirement
- Second requirement
- Third requirement

## Resources
- [Design mockup](link)
- [Technical spec](link)
```

### Attachments

Add files to provide context:

1. Click the attachment area or drag files directly
2. Upload images, documents, or other files
3. Add multiple attachments if needed

Common attachments:
- Screenshots showing bugs or expected behavior
- Design files or mockups
- Reference documents
- Exported data files

## Creating Tasks from Different Views

### From List View

1. Click **+ New Task** at the top
2. Or click in the "Add task" area at the bottom of the list
3. Fill in details as needed

### From Kanban Board

1. Click **+** at the bottom of any column
2. The task is created with that column's status
3. Add details inline or open the full task view

### From Table View

1. Click the **+** button at the bottom
2. Fill in columns directly
3. Tab between fields for quick entry

## Creating Multiple Tasks

When you have several tasks to add:

### Batch Entry

1. Use the quick create shortcut (`T`)
2. Enter a title and press Enter
3. Immediately start typing the next title
4. Repeat for all tasks
5. Go back and add details as needed

### From Chat

When discussing tasks in project chat:
1. Mention creating a task
2. AI coworkers or team members can create tasks directly
3. The task is automatically linked to the conversation

## Task IDs

Every task gets a unique ID based on the project:

- **Format**: `[PREFIX]-[NUMBER]`
- **Example**: If your project prefix is "PROD", tasks are `PROD-1`, `PROD-2`, etc.

Use task IDs to:
- Reference tasks in chat or documentation
- Search for specific tasks
- Link tasks in descriptions

## Templates and Patterns

For recurring task types, establish patterns:

### Bug Reports

```
Title: [Bug] Brief description of the issue
Priority: Based on severity
Description:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots/recordings
```

### Feature Requests

```
Title: [Feature] What the feature does
Priority: Based on importance
Description:
- User story / use case
- Requirements
- Design link (if available)
- Acceptance criteria
```

### Maintenance Tasks

```
Title: [Maintenance] Specific maintenance activity
Priority: Medium (unless critical)
Description:
- What needs to be done
- Why it's needed
- Any dependencies
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write actionable titles">
    Start with a verb that describes what needs to happen. "Update," "Fix," "Create," "Review," "Implement" are all good choices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set realistic priorities">
    Reserve urgent and high priorities for truly important items. If everything is urgent, nothing is.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Break down large tasks">
    If a task will take more than a day or two, consider breaking it into smaller subtasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add enough context">
    Include enough detail in the description that someone else (or future you) can understand and complete the task.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set due dates thoughtfully">
    Only set due dates when there's an actual deadline. Arbitrary dates create false urgency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
