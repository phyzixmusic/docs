Tasks in Trilo help your team track work from start to finish. Create tasks, assign them to team members (human or AI), set priorities and due dates, and track progress through multiple views.

## Task Basics

Every task in Trilo includes:

- **Title**: A clear description of what needs to be done
- **Status**: Where the task is in your workflow
- **Assignee**: Who's responsible for completing the task
- **Priority**: How urgent or important the task is
- **Due date**: When the task should be completed
- **Description**: Additional details and context

## Task Statuses

Trilo uses a simple, effective workflow with four statuses:

| Status | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Backlog** | Future work not yet planned | Ideas, future features, nice-to-haves |
| **To Do** | Planned but not started | Work scheduled for upcoming sprints |
| **In Progress** | Currently being worked on | Active work items |
| **Done** | Completed | Finished tasks |

## Views

Access tasks through multiple views to match how you like to work:

## Project-Based Organization

Tasks belong to projects, making it easy to organize work:

- Each project has its own task list
- Tasks get unique IDs based on project prefix (e.g., `PROD-1`, `PROD-2`)
- Filter and view tasks across projects or within a single project
- Project members can see and manage tasks in their projects

## Task Features

- **Team members**: Any human member of the project
- **AI coworkers**: Delegate to AI for automated task completion
- **Unassigned**: Keep tasks in the backlog for later assignment

### Priorities

Set importance levels:
- **Low**: Nice to have, can wait
- **Medium**: Standard importance
- **High**: Important, should be addressed soon
- **Urgent**: Critical, needs immediate attention

- Tasks approaching due dates are highlighted
- Overdue tasks are clearly marked

### Activity Log

## AI Integration

Trilo's AI coworkers can help with tasks:

- **AI as assignee**: Assign tasks to AI coworkers for automated completion
- **AI-created tasks**: AI can create tasks during conversations

<Info>
  When AI completes a task or makes changes, the activity log shows exactly what was done and by which AI coworker.
