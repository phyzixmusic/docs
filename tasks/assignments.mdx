Task assignments help your team know who's responsible for what. In Trilo, you can assign tasks to human team members or AI coworkers, making it easy to distribute work effectively.

## Assigning Tasks

### When Creating a Task

1. Click **+ New Task**
2. Click the **Assignee** field
3. Select a team member or AI coworker from the dropdown
4. Complete the task creation

### On Existing Tasks

**From task detail:**
1. Open the task
2. Click the Assignee field (shows avatar or "Unassigned")
3. Select the new assignee

**From list/table view:**
1. Click the assignee column for any task
2. Select from the dropdown
3. Change saves automatically

**From Kanban view:**
1. Click the avatar on a card
2. Select the new assignee

## Assignee Options

### Team Members

Any member of the project can be assigned:

- Displays their name and avatar
- They'll receive notifications about the assignment
- Appears in their "My Tasks" view

### AI Coworkers

Assign to AI for automated assistance:

- Select any AI coworker from the dropdown
- AI can work on tasks based on their capabilities
- Activity shows AI-driven changes clearly

### Unassigned

Keep tasks unassigned when:

- The right person hasn't been identified yet
- It's a backlog item not yet ready for work
- You want someone to self-assign

## Notifications

When you assign a task:

### The Assignee Receives

- In-app notification about the assignment
- The task appears in their "My Tasks" view
- Email notification (if enabled in settings)

### Notification Content

Notifications include:
- Task title
- Who assigned it
- Link to open the task directly

## Self-Assignment

Team members can assign tasks to themselves:

1. Find an unassigned task
2. Click the assignee field
3. Select your own name
4. You're now responsible for the task

<Tip>
  Self-assignment is great for teams that work from a shared backlog—members can pick up tasks as they have capacity.
</Tip>

## Changing Assignments

### Reassigning Tasks

To change who's responsible:

1. Click the current assignee
2. Select the new person
3. The change is logged in activity

### Why Reassign

Common reasons to reassign:
- Original assignee is unavailable
- Task requires different expertise
- Workload balancing
- Handoff during project phases

### Assignment History

The activity log tracks all assignment changes:

```
Jan 15, 3:00 PM - Alex reassigned this task from Sarah to Mike
Jan 12, 10:00 AM - Alex assigned this task to Sarah
```

## Assigning to AI Coworkers

AI coworkers can be assigned tasks just like human members.

### When to Assign to AI

- **Content creation**: Writing, editing, summarizing
- **Data analysis**: Processing information
- **Research**: Gathering information on topics
- **Routine tasks**: Repetitive work AI can handle

### How AI Handles Tasks

When assigned to an AI coworker:

1. The AI processes the task based on its capabilities
2. Updates appear in the task activity
3. AI may update status or add comments
4. You'll be notified of completion

### Reviewing AI Work

Always review AI-completed work:
- Check the activity log for AI changes
- Verify the quality of output
- Make any necessary adjustments
- Update status to Done when satisfied

## Bulk Assignments

Assign multiple tasks at once:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select tasks">
    Use checkboxes in list or table view to select multiple tasks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open bulk actions">
    The bulk action toolbar appears.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Assign">
    Choose "Assign to..."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select assignee">
    Pick the person or AI to assign all selected tasks to.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Bulk assignment is useful for:
- Redistributing workload
- Assigning new team member's first tasks
- Moving tasks during project transitions

## Workload Visibility

### Viewing Team Workload

See how tasks are distributed:

1. Filter by assignee to see individual loads
2. Use Table view to compare across team
3. Look for imbalances in assignment

### Balancing Work

Signs of imbalance:
- One person has many urgent tasks
- Many tasks are unassigned
- Some team members have nothing assigned

Solutions:
- Reassign tasks from overloaded members
- Have available members self-assign
- Review priorities and postpone lower items

## My Tasks View

Every team member has a personal task view:

### What It Shows

- All tasks assigned to you
- Across all projects you're in
- Sorted by due date or priority
- Filtered to active statuses by default

### Accessing My Tasks

- Click **My Tasks** in the sidebar
- Or filter any view to show tasks assigned to you

## Assignment Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assign one owner">
    Every task should have one clear owner. If multiple people are involved, create separate tasks or use collaborator mentions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider expertise and capacity">
    Assign based on who has the skills AND the availability to complete the task effectively.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't assign too far ahead">
    Avoid assigning tasks that won't be worked on for weeks. Assign when work is ready to begin.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update stale assignments">
    If an assignee hasn't made progress, check in. The task may need to be reassigned or clarified.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use AI for appropriate tasks">
    AI coworkers are great for specific task types. Match the task to the AI's capabilities for best results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't find someone in the assignee list">
    - Check they're a member of the project
    - They may need to be invited to the project first
    - Verify they have the correct role/permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assignee didn't get notification">
    - Check their notification settings
    - Verify email notifications are enabled
    - Ensure the assignment saved (refresh and check)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI coworker not completing task">
    - Verify the task description is clear
    - Check if the AI coworker has the needed capabilities
    - Some tasks require human intervention
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
