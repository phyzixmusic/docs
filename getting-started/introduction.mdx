## Core Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you get the most out of Trilo:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspaces">
    A workspace is your team's home base. It contains all your projects, resources, and team members. Most teams have one workspace, but you can create multiple for different organizations or clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Areas">
    Areas are top-level categories within your workspace. Use them to organize projects by department, team, or initiative. For example: "Engineering," "Marketing," or "Q1 Launch."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Projects">
    Projects live within areas and contain your actual work—tasks, knowledge base resources, calendar events, and chat messages. Each project has its own channel and settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resources">
    Resources are the content you create in your knowledge base. This includes pages (documents), spreadsheets, and boards (whiteboards). Resources can be organized within projects or shared across your workspace.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Coworkers">
    AI coworkers are intelligent assistants that can help with various tasks. You can chat with them, assign them work, and even create custom coworkers tailored to your team's needs.
