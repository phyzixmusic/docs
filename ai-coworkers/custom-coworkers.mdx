- Define specific behaviors and constraints
- Build AI that understands your context

## Defining Behavior

### Base Prompt

The base prompt tells the AI how to behave. This is the most important configuration.

**Structure your prompt to include:**

1. **Role definition**: Who is this AI?
2. **Expertise**: What does it know?
3. **Tone and style**: How should it communicate?
4. **Guidelines**: Rules it should follow
5. **Constraints**: What it should avoid

### Example Base Prompt

```

**Role:** Help team members draft responses to customer
inquiries, ensuring consistent and helpful communication.

**Expertise:**
- Product knowledge for Acme's software suite
- Common customer issues and solutions
- Support best practices

**Tone:**
- Friendly and professional
- Empathetic to customer concerns
- Clear and concise
- Solution-oriented

**Guidelines:**
- Always acknowledge the customer's concern first
- Provide clear next steps
- Offer additional resources when relevant
- End with a helpful closing

**Avoid:**
- Technical jargon customers won't understand
- Blaming the customer
- Making promises we can't keep
- Sharing internal processes
```
