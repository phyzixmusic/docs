AI coworkers are designed to understand natural language and help with a wide range of tasks. This guide will help you communicate effectively to get the best results.

## Starting a Conversation

### Opening a Chat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an AI coworker">
    Click on an AI coworker in the sidebar or Direct Messages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type your message">
    Enter your question or request in the message box.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Press Enter to send your message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for response">
    The AI processes your message and responds in real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### First Messages

Good opening messages:
- State what you need help with
- Include relevant context
- Be specific about the desired outcome

**Examples:**
```
"I need help writing a project proposal for a new mobile app feature"

"Can you explain how API rate limiting works?"

"Help me brainstorm marketing ideas for our product launch"
```

## Effective Communication

### Be Specific

Vague requests get vague answers. Be specific about what you need.

**Less effective:**
```
"Help with the email"
```

**More effective:**
```
"Help me write a professional email to a client explaining that their
project will be delayed by two weeks due to technical issues. The tone
should be apologetic but confident about the new timeline."
```

### Provide Context

The more relevant information you share, the better the response.

**Include when helpful:**
- Background on the situation
- Your goals or objectives
- Constraints or requirements
- Target audience
- Tone or style preferences

**Example:**
```
"I'm preparing a presentation for our executive team about Q3 results.
They prefer concise bullet points with key metrics highlighted.
Our main achievement was 40% revenue growth. Can you help me
structure the presentation outline?"
```

### Be Direct

State exactly what you want the AI to do.

**Less effective:**
```
"I was thinking maybe the document could be better?"
```

**More effective:**
```
"Please review this document and:
1. Fix any grammar errors
2. Improve the clarity of the introduction
3. Add a stronger conclusion"
```

## Conversation Flow

### Building on Previous Messages

AI coworkers remember the conversation context. Build on previous messages:

```
You: Can you summarize this article? [attachment]
AI: Here are the main points from the article...

You: Now create a tweet thread from those points
AI: Here's a thread with 5 tweets covering the key ideas...

You: Make the second tweet more engaging
AI: Here's a revised version of tweet #2...
```

### Asking Follow-Up Questions

Continue the conversation naturally:

```
You: What are best practices for user authentication?
AI: Here are key best practices: [explanation]

You: Can you explain point 3 in more detail?
AI: Of course! Point 3 is about... [detailed explanation]

You: How would I implement that in Node.js?
AI: Here's how you would implement it... [code example]
```

### Redirecting

If the conversation goes off track:

```
You: Actually, let's go back to the original topic.
Can you focus on the security aspects?

AI: Of course! Let me refocus on security...
```

## Giving Feedback

### When Output Is Good

Confirm when you're happy:
```
You: Perfect, that's exactly what I needed!
```

### When Output Needs Changes

Be specific about what to change:

```
You: This is good, but can you:
- Make it shorter (about half the length)
- Use simpler language
- Add more concrete examples
```

### When Output Is Wrong

Correct misunderstandings:

```
You: That's not quite right. I meant [clarification].
Can you try again with this in mind?
```

## Types of Requests

### Questions

Ask for information or explanations:

```
"What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?"
"How do I calculate compound interest?"
"What are the best practices for code reviews?"
```

### Task Completion

Request specific work to be done:

```
"Write a product description for our new feature"
"Create a list of interview questions for a marketing manager role"
"Generate test cases for the login functionality"
```

### Analysis

Ask for analysis of information:

```
"Summarize the key points from this document"
"What are the pros and cons of this approach?"
"Identify potential issues with this proposal"
```

### Creative Help

Get creative assistance:

```
"Brainstorm names for our new product"
"Help me come up with a tagline for the campaign"
"Suggest alternative solutions to this problem"
```

### Editing

Request improvements to content:

```

```

## Using Attachments

1. Click the attachment icon
2. Upload your file (document, image, etc.)
3. Add your question or request
4. Send

**Example:**

"Can you summarize the key findings from this report?"
```

### What You Can Share

- Documents (PDF, Word, etc.)

## Formatting Tips

### For Complex Requests

Use structure to clarify complex requests:

```
I need help with a marketing email. Here are the details:

**Product:** New project management feature
**Audience:** Existing customers
**Goal:** Announce the feature and drive adoption
**Tone:** Excited but professional
**Length:** About 300 words
**Include:** Feature benefits, how to access it, support contact
```

### For Multiple Items

Use lists when asking for multiple things:

```
Please review this proposal and:
1. Check for logical consistency
2. Identify any gaps in the argument
3. Suggest improvements to the structure
4. Note any unclear sections
```

## Conversation Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple, then refine">
    Begin with a straightforward request. If the response isn't perfect, provide feedback and iterate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One topic per conversation">
    For unrelated topics, start a new conversation. This keeps context clear.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Save useful responses">
    Copy important outputs to your knowledge base or documents for future reference.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Experiment">
    Try different ways of asking. You'll learn what works best for different types of requests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Conversations

### Writing Help

```
You: I need to write a rejection email to a job candidate.
It should be kind but clear, and encourage them to apply
for future positions.

AI: Here's a draft rejection email:

Subject: Your Application to [Company Name]

Dear [Name],

Thank you for taking the time to interview for the
[Position] role at [Company Name]...

[continues with full email]

You: Good, but can you make the opening warmer?

AI: Here's a revised version with a warmer opening:

Dear [Name],

I really appreciate you sharing your experience and
enthusiasm with us during the interview process...
```

### Research

```
You: What are the main differences between PostgreSQL and MySQL
for a new web application project?

AI: Here's a comparison of PostgreSQL vs MySQL for web applications:

**PostgreSQL**
- Better for complex queries and large datasets
- Stronger JSON support
- More standards-compliant
...

**MySQL**
- Generally faster for simple read operations
- Easier to set up and manage
- Better hosting support
...

You: We'll have a lot of JSON data. Tell me more about
PostgreSQL's JSON support.

AI: PostgreSQL has excellent JSON capabilities...
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI doesn't understand my request">
    - Try rephrasing more simply
    - Break complex requests into smaller parts
    - Provide more context
    - Give an example of what you want
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response is too long/short">
    - Specify desired length: "Keep it under 100 words"
    - Ask for more detail: "Can you expand on this?"
    - Request format: "Give me bullet points" or "Write a full paragraph"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong tone or style">
    - Specify the tone: "Make it more casual" or "Write formally"
    - Give examples of the style you want
