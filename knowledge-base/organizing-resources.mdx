A well-organized knowledge base helps your team find information quickly and keeps everyone aligned. This guide covers strategies and features for keeping your resources organized.

## Organization Hierarchy

Trilo uses a three-level hierarchy to organize content:

```
Workspace
├── Area (e.g., "Engineering")
│   ├── Project (e.g., "API Development")
│   │   ├── Resources (Pages, Spreadsheets, Boards)
│   │   ├── Tasks
│   │   └── Chat
│   └── Project (e.g., "Frontend")
│       └── ...
└── Area (e.g., "Marketing")
    └── Project (e.g., "Q1 Campaign")
        └── ...
```

### Areas

Areas are high-level categories for grouping related projects:

**Common area structures:**
- **By department**: Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Operations
- **By client**: Client A, Client B, Internal
- **By initiative**: Product Launch, Growth, Infrastructure
- **By time**: Q1 2024, Q2 2024, Ongoing

### Projects

Projects contain the actual work and resources:

- Each project has its own Resources section
- Projects have dedicated chat channels
- Tasks are organized within projects
- Projects can have their own member permissions

## Organizing Within Projects

### Resource List

The Resources section shows all resources in a project:

- **List view**: See all resources with key details
- **Sort options**: By name, date created, date modified
- **Filter**: Show only pages, spreadsheets, or boards

### Naming Conventions

Consistent naming helps everyone find what they need:

<Tip>
  Establish naming conventions early and document them for your team.
</Tip>

**Good naming patterns:**

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Meeting notes | `[Date] Meeting - [Topic]` | `2024-01-15 Meeting - Sprint Planning` |
| Documentation | `[System] - [Topic]` | `API - Authentication Guide` |
| Templates | `[Template] [Type]` | `[Template] Project Brief` |
| Versions | `[Name] v[Number]` | `Product Spec v2` |

### Using Prefixes

Prefixes help categorize resources at a glance:

- `[Draft]` - Work in progress
- `[Archive]` - Historical reference
- `[Template]` - Reusable starting point
- `[WIP]` - Active work, not final

## Active Work vs. Archive

### Managing Active Resources

Keep your resource list focused on current work:

- Pin frequently-used resources to keep them at the top
- Review resources regularly and archive what's no longer active
- Use clear status indicators in names if helpful

### Archiving Resources

Archive resources that are no longer actively used but need to be preserved:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the resource">
    Click on the resource you want to archive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the menu">
    Click the **...** menu in the top right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Archive">
    Select **Archive**. The resource will be moved to the archive.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Accessing Archived Resources

To view archived resources:

1. Go to the Resources section
2. Click **View archive** or filter by archived status
3. Archived resources appear grayed out
4. Click **Restore** to bring a resource back to active status

## Cross-Project Resources

Sometimes resources are relevant to multiple projects.

### Linking to Resources

Reference resources from other projects:

1. Copy the resource link from the **...** menu
2. Paste the link in pages or chat messages
3. Links are clickable and show preview cards

### Moving Resources

Move a resource to a different project:

1. Open the resource
2. Click **...** menu
3. Select **Move to...**
4. Choose the destination project
5. Confirm the move

<Warning>
  Moving a resource may change who has access to it based on project permissions.
</Warning>

## Templates

Create reusable templates for common resource types.

### Creating a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a resource">
    Create a page, spreadsheet, or board with the structure you want to reuse.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add template content">
    Add placeholder text, structure, and formatting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name it clearly">
    Use a prefix like `[Template]` in the name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Create a templates project">
    Keep all templates in a dedicated project for easy access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using a Template

1. Open the template resource
2. Click **...** menu and select **Duplicate**
3. Rename the duplicate for your specific use
4. Move it to the appropriate project if needed
5. Fill in the content

## Search and Discovery

### Global Search

Use search to find resources across your workspace:

- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to open search
- Type keywords from the resource title or content
- Results show recent items first
- Click a result to open the resource

### Search Tips

- Search finds matches in titles and content
- Use specific keywords for better results
- Recent items appear higher in results
- Filter by resource type if needed

## Organization Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep it flat when possible">
    Avoid creating too many nested levels. A flatter structure is easier to navigate and understand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archive regularly">
    Schedule regular cleanup sessions to archive completed or outdated resources. This keeps your active view focused.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document your system">
    Create a "How We Organize" page that explains your team's conventions. This helps new team members get up to speed quickly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review and refine">
    Your organization needs will evolve. Periodically review your structure and make adjustments as your team grows or changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming">
    Agree on naming conventions as a team and stick to them. Consistency makes everything easier to find.
  </Accordion>
