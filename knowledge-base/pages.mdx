## The Editor

Trilo uses a powerful block-based editor that makes creating beautiful documents easy.

### Basic Formatting

Select text to access the formatting toolbar:

- **Bold**: `Cmd/Ctrl + B`
- **Italic**: `Cmd/Ctrl + I`
- **Underline**: `Cmd/Ctrl + U`
- **Strikethrough**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S`
- **Code**: `Cmd/Ctrl + E`
- **Link**: `Cmd/Ctrl + K`

### Slash Commands

Type `/` anywhere in your document to access the block menu. This lets you quickly insert:

| `/h3` | Heading 3 |
| `/bullet` | Bullet list |

### Block Types

#### Headings

Use headings to structure your document:

<Tip>
  Well-structured headings make documents easier to scan and create a better table of contents.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Structure with headings">
    Break long documents into sections with headings. This improves readability and creates a scannable structure.
