Notifications keep you informed about activity in your workspace. Configure them to stay updated without being overwhelmed.

## Notification Channels

Trilo can notify you through multiple channels:

| Channel | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **In-app** | Alerts within Trilo | Real-time awareness |
| **Desktop** | System notifications | Immediate attention |
| **Mobile** | Push notifications | On-the-go updates |
| **Email** | Email summaries | Catching up later |

## Accessing Notification Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click **Settings** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Notifications">
    Navigate to the **Notifications** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure preferences">
    Adjust settings for each notification type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notification Types

### Messages

Configure chat notification preferences:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **All messages** | Notify for every message |
| **Mentions only** | Only when @mentioned |
| **Nothing** | No chat notifications |

<Tip>
  "Mentions only" is a good balance—you're notified when you need to respond but not overwhelmed by every message.
</Tip>

### Direct Messages

DM notification settings:

- **All DMs**: Every direct message
